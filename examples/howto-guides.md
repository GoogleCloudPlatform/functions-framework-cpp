# How-to Guides: Index

* [Running your function as Docker container] - building and running your
  function into a Docker image and starting the function on your workstation.
* [Deploy your function to Cloud Run] - continue by deploying a C++ function to
  Cloud Run.
* [Deploy a C++ Pub/Sub function to Cloud Run] - deploy C++ functions handling
  Pub/Sub events to Cloud Run.
* [Local Development] - use the Functions Framework without Docker, for faster
  local development, testing, and debugging.
